# 🎯 ICLAD GenAI Chip Hackathon @ DAC 2025

The **ICLAD Hackathon 2025** is an **in-person** event held on **June 22** at **Moscone Center West** 🏢, co-located with **DAC 2025**. Participation requires **I LOVE DAC** registration ❤️. This competitive, hands-on 🧠 research and educational event challenges participants to use **language models** to solve real-world chip design problems across the **RTL to GDSII flow**—including RTL design, verification, and physical design 🔧📐.

## 🛤️ Hackathon Tracks

The hackathon features two exciting tracks:

1. **💻 SLM Challenge**  
   Solve design tasks using **small language models (SLMs)** on **low-cost laptops** provided at the event.

2. **☁️ Open Challenge**  
   Use **any GenAI models**, including **large language models (LLMs)** running in the **cloud**. For this hackathon we have supprot to Gemini APIs via GCP instances. 

🏆 *Separate prizes* will be awarded to winners in each track!

## 📂 Problem Categories

Choose from four problem categories:

1. **🛠️ GenAI for Spec2Tapeout (ASU)**  
   Build an agent that generates RTL and GDS from design specs—automated start-to-finish flow. 

2. **🔍 GenAI for Design Verification (Google)**  
   Given buggy RTL and specs, create testbenches to catch sneaky logic bugs 🐞⚡.

3. **🌀 Miscellaneous CVDP Problems (NVIDIA)**  
   Different tasks that include RTL debugging, testbench integration, design edits, and EDA workflow setup.

4. **🔧 GenAI for Logic Synthesis (Qualcomm, NXP)**  
   Repair broken gate-level netlists with smart ECO detection using the correct RTL as a reference.

📊 Each category has **multiple problems** with varying levels of difficulty. Solve as many problems as you can across multiple categories. Winners will be named **per category and per track**.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure and Resources

### 🖥️ SLM Track

- Each team gets a **Qualcomm X-Elite AI laptop** 💼 with pre-installed open SLMs and EDA tools.
- A **tutorial session** will be held before DAC on how to use these tools 🧑‍🏫.
- Teams may also use their own trained SLMs if desired.
Documentation for this is (here)[https://github.com/ICLAD-Hackathon/ICLAD-Hackathon-2025/blob/main/SLM-laptop-setup.md]

### 🌐 Open Challenge Track

- Access **Gemini APIs** and **Google Cloud compute resources** 💡☁️.
- Teams have received **GCP credentials** via email 📧.
- Docs provided for:
  1. 🔧 Setting up Google Cloud instances  
  2. 🐳 Pulling docker images per problem (preloaded with tools + data)  
  3. 🤖 Querying Gemini APIs from inside docker or directly via GCP
Documentation for this is (here)[https://github.com/ICLAD-Hackathon/ICLAD-Hackathon-2025/blob/main/GCP-infrastructure-setup.md]
